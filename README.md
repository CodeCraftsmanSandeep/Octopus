## 🏗️ Design Overview

The foundation of **Octopus** is built upon robust database models that logically represent a real-world enterprise. The current design leverages a **relational model** to efficiently manage and query vast amounts of data.

### 🔍 Relational Model

The design of Octopus utilizes an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to abstract and represent the underlying data structure. Here's a snapshot of the relational model currently implemented:

### 🖥️ User Views and Privileges

The platform caters to different user roles, each with specific privileges and access levels. The following diagram illustrates the varying levels of access for the three primary user types in the current version of **Octopus**:

## ⚙️ PostgreSQL and Advanced Techniques

The backend of **Octopus** is powered by **PostgreSQL**, one of the most powerful and feature-rich database management systems available. The implementation involves:

- **Sophisticated Techniques**: Utilization of advanced features like **recursive triggers** and **encryption** ensures data integrity and security.
- **Memory Optimizations**: Strategic use of memory to accelerate query processing and reduce latency, significantly improving performance.
- **Recursive Triggers**: Enables complex operations by automatically triggering nested actions, making the database self-sustaining and highly efficient.
- **Encryption**: Implements robust encryption protocols to secure sensitive data, ensuring that privacy is maintained at all times.
- **Optimizations**: Memory optimization techniques have been used to save time, ensuring that every bit of performance is squeezed out from the available resources.

The PostgreSQL codebase is not only highly optimized but also intricate, reflecting a deep understanding of database internals and a commitment to delivering top-notch performance.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is a labor of love and a rich learning experience. While **Octopus** has immense potential for growth, it is crucial to recognize that it is a solo endeavor, and as such, it may not rival industry giants like GitHub or GitLab in terms of stability or feature set. However, the purpose of this project extends far beyond competition:

- **Algorithmic Mastery**: Crafting sophisticated algorithms that solve complex problems.
- **Codebase Management**: Gaining experience in managing and scaling large codebases.
- **Effective Documentation**: Learning the importance of clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation.

The knowledge and skills acquired through this project are invaluable, akin to the experience a Computer Science student gains from building a prototype compiler. While not aiming to create a new standard, the process deepens understanding and hones skills that will be applicable in future endeavors.
