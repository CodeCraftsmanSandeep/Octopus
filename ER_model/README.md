## Introduction

Entity-relationship data model (often abbreviated as ER data model (or) ER model) is one of the data models, which specifies the structure of a database. <br/>
ER data model employs 3 basic concepts : <br/>

2) entity sets 
3) relationship sets

ER diagram is a graphical way of expressing the logical structure of a database. <br/>	

## Entity sets and their attributes
An entity is basically a distinguishable object. An entity set is a set of entities of the same type that share the same attributes (properties). <br/>
A database is a collection of entity sets, which are related by relationships. <br/>
